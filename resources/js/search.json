Because our input value in check_pin is a signed int type, we need to cast the return value from random as a signed int, otherwise the values will never match. Python3 does not differentiate between long and int values natively, so to do the conversion we need to include the ctypes import in our code.","The value at that address is the same value passed to local_c.
